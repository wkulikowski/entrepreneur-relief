# Entrepreneur Relief
Entrepreneur Relief is our answer to COVID19 epidemic forcing local businesses to close. It allows:
- the business owners to easily produce vouchers
- the customers to buy them and ensure that their favorite dance schools / hairdressers / caffees survive the enpidemic

## Purpose
Together with a team of 6 we participated in a Polish hackathon -- [HackCrisis](https://www.hackcrisis.com/). We got shortlisted to top 30 (out of over valid 100 submissions), but felt short in the final ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is working MVP, you can check it out at https://eloquent-mayer-d20ce1.netlify.com/ (probably a dead link in the future) or locally with `yarn install / yarn serve!`

## Product
We have built the app with VueJS for frontend and AWS Lambda for handling emails.
Our designs have been done with ‚ù§Ô∏è and [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MaZjbGi6JZENP5fqP52fS7/Relief-Wireframes?node-id=45%3A1355)
